# Sorting
java project
This is final project of Data Structure subject. The project is taken from coursera website and the course name is  "Using efficient sorting algorithms to sort the Tax data".
The project was opened in the rhyme external cloud development environment. There are some common sorting techniques to sort the tax data there are two java files one is County tax and second is Counties .CounntTax stores two variable tax and county. All the sorting tax techniques are used to sort the data of tax rate of countries. In this project the data is sorted in ascending order.
I have applied some simple sorting techniques like bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort ,merge sort and quick sort.

I have complete this 2 hours non credit hour project and the the link of certificate is given below;

Set up Eclipse (and Java) to run the project
Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE) to develop and run our Java code. Eclipse is a powerful, industry-grade IDE. While it might be a little confusing at first because of its power, once you get the hang of it, it will provide for a very pleasant programming experience and you’ll wonder how you ever programmed without it! Of course, you are welcome to use any Java development environment you like. You'll be on your own to make sure you have all the libraries and your classpath configured correctly, though I'm sure learners in the forum will be happy to help.
Step 1: Install the Java JDK, if you don’t have it already installed
Go to http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
 Click on one of the buttons to download the latest version of the Java SE JDK (it will be a later version than the screenshot below). These buttons are highlighted in the screenshot below (click either one).
Accept the license agreement in the first list of files titled “Java SE Development Kit …” and then download the file that is right for your operating system.
Install the JDK as appropriate for your operating system
Download, “install” and setup eclipse
Once you install eclips, Go to Window->Preferences:
Then, in the window that opens select Java->Installed JREs in the menu on the left, then click Search
Navigate to where you installed the JDK in step 1. Make sure you select the JDK directory and not the newly installed JRE directory! Then click OK.
After a moment, eclipse should list a second JRE in the Java->Installed JREs window. Select the JRE in the newly installed JDK folder, and click OK:
